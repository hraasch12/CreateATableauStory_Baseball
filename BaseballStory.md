## Summary
In this visualization I used a variety of visualization techniques to explore the Baseball Data data set. The features included in this dataset are Handedness, Name, Avg (batting average), Height, Weight, and HR (home runs). I analyzed this data to see which variables had an effect on the performance of the baseball players based on HR and Avg. 

## Design
#### Original:
To begin my analysis I used histograms and a bar chart to explore the data. The bar chart "Frequency of Players Per Handedness shows the number of players that are left handed, right handed, or both. The Frequency of Height histogram shows the distribution of height amongst the players. We see that 72" is the most popular height with 232 players being that height. Next I examined the weight distribution amongst players using a histogram. This histogram shows that the most popular weight is 180 with 299 players weighing that amount. 

Next I started to explore which handedness has the highest performanced based off of Batting Average and Home Runs. First I used Box Plots to look at the handedness and Batting Averages. We see that players with handedness of both have a median average of 0.125. Left handed players have a median average of 0.1940 and right handed players have a median average of 0.1625. These results show us that left handed players have the highest median batting average amongst right and both handed players. I then used a bar chart to look at the average batting average. The averages were slightly higher than the medians, and interestingly showed the left handed players have a greater average, 0.20505, than the left handed group at 0.20451. 

The second Box Plot looks at the number of Home Runs by handedness. The median for both handed players is 30.5, the median for left handed players is 78.5, and the median for right handed players is 93. These results show that the group with the highest median home runs is Right handed players. The bar chart for the handedness and average number of home runs matches what we saw in the box plot wit the Left handed group having the highest average of home runs followed by the right handed players with both handed players having the lowest average number of home runs. 



## Feedback
--Add a text chart to show the total number of records. 
-- Bar charts for batting anverage and home runs are not in teh same row as their box plot counter parts.
